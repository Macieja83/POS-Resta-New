# Archive

This folder contains legacy/duplicate project directories kept for reference.

## Why?
During early development, multiple copies of the same apps were kept side-by-side (POS + restaurant-shop).
That makes it very easy to edit the wrong copy and then wonder why a fix "didn't work".

## Canonical apps (source of truth)
- POS backend+frontend: `pos-system/`
- EmpApp: `empapp/`

If we need anything from archived folders, we can cherry-pick specific files back.
